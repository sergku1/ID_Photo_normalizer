     <p align="center"><h2>A program for normalizing images of passports or ID cards and collecting information from them into a structure of named (first name-last name) folders - data storage structure </h2></p>
<p><font color="red"><b></b></font></p>
<p>The program is part of the management program of a company engaged in personnel outsourcing and is not the property of this company</p> 
<p>Программа:  </p> 
<p></p>1. Converts input files such as .pdf, .bmp, jp2, png, .webp, .pgm, .jpe, .JPG, .jpg to a single standard .jpeg
<p>2. Can eliminate distortions that appear due to shooting a document at an angle - distortion</p>
<p>3. Scales all images to the same resolution so that the image size is the same regardless of viewing application</p>
<p>4.After normalizing the image, it is displayed on the screen for convenient entry into data entry windows. OCR was not used due to the possible extreme variety of fonts, the quality of shooting and the responsibility of the information entered</p>
<p>5.When entering data into input windows, auto-input and support functions are used to make input easier and faster</p>
<p>6. After entering the full name, the program creates a folder called First Name Patronymic Last Name in a folder called Info, for each client, where it places the prepared image file and names it the same as the folder, but with a .jpeg extension</p>
<p>7.The program also works well with Patronymics, which is very important in the case of Bulgarians (in our experience)</p>
<p>8. The program collects all collected data into one file in text format with the same name as the copy of the document and is placed in the same folder First Name Last Name
<p>9. When entering first and last names, the program checks for matches with entries in the Info folder and displays them on the screen, grouping them in groups of 10 for display.  This makes it convenient to work with fairly large volumes of records.  This allows you to accurately control the absence of duplicates and navigate the exact naming of the employee - where is his first name, where is his last name, and where is his patronymic
<p>10. Эта программа не предназначена для редактирования имеющихся текстовых записей.</p>
<p>11. В данном варианте программы еще не реализован механизм обработки клиентов с полностью совпадающими полными именами.</p>
